# MCP (Master Control Program) Configurations

This project uses several MCP configurations for database access and automation:

## 1. Development Environment - 'DeepView'
- **Purpose**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for IDEs to analyze large codebases using Gemini's extensive context window
- **Connection Type**: MCP server integration with development tools
- **Access Level**: Restricted (focused on codebase analysis and context management)
- **Security Level**: Moderate (prevents destructive operations)
- **Use Cases**:
  - Enabling IDEs to perform deep codebase analysis
  - Leveraging Gemini's large context window for advanced code understanding
  - Supporting code navigation, refactoring, and search in large projects
  - Facilitating context-aware development workflows

## 2. Development Environment - 'Playwright'
- **Purpose**: Browser automation MCP server using Playwright to run tests, navigate pages, capture screenshots, scrape content, and automate web interactions reliably.
- **Connection Type**: MCP server integration with Playwright automation framework.
- **Access Level**: Automation and testing (web browser).
- **Security Level**: Controlled (sandboxed browser environments).
- **Use Cases**:
  - Automated end-to-end testing of web applications.
  - Web scraping and content extraction.
  - UI regression testing and screenshot capture.
  - Automating repetitive browser tasks.

## 3. Development Environment - 'browsermcp'
- **Purpose**: Fast, lightweight MCP server (by UI-TARS) empowering LLMs with browser automation via Puppeteerâ€™s structured accessibility data, featuring optional vision mode for complex visual understanding and flexible, cross-platform configuration.
- **Connection Type**: MCP server integration with Puppeteer and accessibility APIs.
- **Access Level**: Automation and accessibility (web browser).
- **Security Level**: Controlled (browser sandboxing).
- **Use Cases**:
  - Automating browser interactions for LLMs.
  - Extracting structured accessibility data from web pages.
  - Enabling vision-based automation for complex UI tasks.
  - Cross-platform browser automation.

## 4. Development Environment - 'Sequential Thinking'
- **Purpose**: Dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thought sequences.
- **Connection Type**: MCP server supporting sequential reasoning and planning.
- **Access Level**: Cognitive workflow management.
- **Security Level**: N/A (logic-based).
- **Use Cases**:
  - Step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks.
  - Reflective planning and execution.
  - Dynamic adjustment of problem-solving strategies.

## 5. Development Environment - 'context7'
- **Purpose**: Enhanced context management for LLMs, supporting up to 7 layers of contextual information for improved reasoning and understanding.
- **Connection Type**: MCP server for context stacking and retrieval.
- **Access Level**: Contextual data management.
- **Security Level**: N/A.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Multi-layered context tracking for LLMs.
  - Improved context-aware responses.
  - Advanced context switching and retrieval.

## 6. Development Environment - 'fetch'
- **Purpose**: Web content fetching and conversion for efficient LLM usage.
- **Connection Type**: MCP server for HTTP requests and content parsing.
- **Access Level**: Data acquisition.
- **Security Level**: Controlled (network access).
- **Use Cases**:
  - Fetching web pages and APIs for LLM input.
  - Converting web content to structured formats.
  - Efficient data retrieval for downstream processing.

## 7. Development Environment - 'everything-search'
- **Purpose**: Fast file searching capabilities across Windows (using Everything SDK), macOS (using mdfind command), and Linux (using locate/plocate command).
- **Connection Type**: MCP server integrating with OS-level search tools.
- **Access Level**: File system search.
- **Security Level**: OS-level permissions.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Instant file search across large file systems.
  - Cross-platform file discovery.
  - Integrating file search into automation workflows.

**Important Notes**:
- Always use the appropriate MCP configuration based on your environment
- Exercise caution with critical operations in all environments
- Follow security best practices when handling database connections
